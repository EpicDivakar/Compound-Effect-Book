# Compound-Effect-Book
(Lesson Money Trap)
Earning and alot of money and not saving the tax portion from the that is a type of trap in which the writter intially fell, now he need to earn more and can’t spent that in as expenses as he need to pay a huge amount of tax and by not saving money for the tax he is digging a grave for himself.

and what the accountant suggested is to note down after single rupee which is spent in 30 days, and this directly impacted my expenses as I usually don’t buy things just because I need to write it down in the notepad . Eventually noting down everything worked so much for him now he knows where he is spending , where he need to stop and do’s and don’t for money atleast and here the author also suggest to keep track of everything which you do in your life either it is studies , relationship with mom and dad or anyone , tracking things helps alot in everything atleast noe you know what are you actually doing and what you need to do next.

All winners are trackers.

Once you start tracking the record, you can also know where you are spending and that one dollar you are paying today is equivalent to taking out five dollars from your future pocket in 20 years or ten dollars from your future pocket after 30 years. That’s the power of the compound effect. Start this habit today for atleast 3 weeks as scientist says working on the same thing fro three week is a good enough time to see a lil bit results . and the author choose investing over spending 

## The Unsung , Unseen Hero

Once we start tracking our attention comes on small things which we are doing right and small things we are doing wrong, and when we try to improve those small mistakes over time everyday , we’ll begin to see amazing results. but don’t expect immediate results .  because those small improvement willl initially will not be visible to you but with time and the power of compunding it will so up and give good results.

Example : the horse is win by race but did he also get a lil amount of price money no . he got the 10 times more than everything . IS the horse 10 times faster no it just a little bit better than others .

thats the power of little things adding up. 

## Take a Walk

Author suggested rahul to take a walk through his office and appreitaite those mind who are actually doing good at there works and this surprised the employee which lead to better results in company betterment . 

As again the difference between the third player is not about that is 100 ot 1000 timmes faster than him it just he/ she is lil bit better than him
