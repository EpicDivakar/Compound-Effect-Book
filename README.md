(Lesson Money Trap)
Earning and alot of money and not saving the tax portion from the that is a type of trap in which the writter intially fell, now he need to earn more and can’t spent that in as expenses as he need to pay a huge amount of tax and by not saving money for the tax he is digging a grave for himself.

and what the accountant suggested is to note down after single rupee which is spent in 30 days, and this directly impacted my expenses as I usually don’t buy things just because I need to write it down in the notepad . Eventually noting down everything worked so much for him now he knows where he is spending , where he need to stop and do’s and don’t for money atleast and here the author also suggest to keep track of everything which you do in your life either it is studies , relationship with mom and dad or anyone , tracking things helps alot in everything atleast noe you know what are you actually doing and what you need to do next.

All winners are trackers.
